![Multi-Cloud Serverless Framework](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/480ec64e-d284-49b4-afd1-c7b6a4d75c86)
The image illustrates a **Multi-Cloud Serverless Framework** that distributes traffic between Azure and AWS using an API Manager. Here's a breakdown of the setup and how Terraform scripts can be used to achieve this configuration:

### Overview

1. **Traffic Distribution:**
   - Traffic from mobile and user applications is routed via the internet to an API Manager.
   - The API Manager operates in an active/active mode, distributing 50% of the traffic to Azure and 50% to AWS.

2. **Azure Setup:**
   - **Azure API Management** handles requests.
   - Services include:
     - Cart, Orders, Inventory
     - Azure Event Hubs for event streaming
     - Blob Storage for data storage
     - Notification Hub for push notifications

3. **AWS Setup:**
   - **Amazon API Gateway** manages incoming requests.
   - Services include:
     - Cart, Orders, Inventory
     - SQS (Simple Queue Service) for message queuing
     - S3 for storage
     - SNS (Simple Notification Service) for notifications

4. **Traffic Routing:**
   - Azure Front Door and AWS Route 53 are used for routing traffic to respective cloud services.

### Achieving This with Terraform

Terraform can automate the deployment and management of this multi-cloud setup. Here's a high-level approach:

#### **1. Define Providers:**

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}
```

#### **2. Set Up Azure Resources:**

- **API Management:**

```hcl
resource "azurerm_api_management" "example" {
  name                = "example-api-management"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  publisher_name      = "Example Company"
  publisher_email     = "api@example.com"
}
```

- **Event Hubs, Blob Storage, Notification Hub:**

```hcl
resource "azurerm_eventhub_namespace" "example" {
  name                = "example-eventhubns"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "examplestoracc"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

resource "azurerm_notification_hub" "example" {
  name                = "example-notificationhub"
  namespace_name      = azurerm_notification_hub_namespace.example.name
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}
```

#### **3. Set Up AWS Resources:**

- **API Gateway:**

```hcl
resource "aws_api_gateway_rest_api" "example" {
  name        = "example-api-gateway"
  description = "Example API Gateway"
}
```

- **SQS, S3, SNS:**

```hcl
resource "aws_sqs_queue" "example" {
  name = "example-queue"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "example-bucket"
}

resource "aws_sns_topic" "example" {
  name = "example-topic"
}
```

#### **4. Traffic Management:**

- Use Azure Front Door and AWS Route 53 configurations to manage traffic routing.

By using Terraform scripts like these, you can automate the deployment and configuration of a multi-cloud serverless architecture that seamlessly integrates services across Azure and AWS.
