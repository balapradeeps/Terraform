# Data Sources

Terraform data sources is a way to get information from external sources and use it in your Terraform configuration. You can use data sources to query data from cloud provider APIs, other Terraform states, or any other service that exposes data. Data sources can help you make your configuration more dynamic, flexible, and reusable.

For example, you can use a data source to get the list of availability zones in a region, and use it to create subnets in each zone. You can also use a data source to get the outputs of another Terraform state, and use them as inputs for your resources. You can also use a data source to get the IP address of a domain name, and use it to create a DNS record.

Here is a simple example of how to use a data source in Terraform:

# Define a data source to get the current caller identity

data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

# Use the data source attribute to create a resource
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
bucket = "my-bucket-${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}"
acl    = "private"
}

This example uses the aws_caller_identity data source to get the current AWS account ID, and uses it to create a unique name for an S3 bucket
